- Implement onPause.
- Implement validation for time settings.
- Implement buttons.
- Implement 10 second break configuration.
- When no minutes, there should be no tailing zeros.

- Think about how it should count.
	- if a round is 10 seconds, should we count from 10 to 1, or 9 to 0, or make it seem like we are counting from 10 to 0, but actually counting from 9 to 0? In boxing, they simply hide the counter. I don't think that's right.

- Done: Implement 10 second sound.
- Done: Boxing ring
	- start: 1
	- 10 seconds: clacker
	- end: 3 rings

	- break
	- 10 seconds: whistle
	- start: 1
